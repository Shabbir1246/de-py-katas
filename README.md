# Northcoders Data Engineering Katas

Fork this repository to your own GitHub account because you will be pushing your own solutions to it.

Clone your fork of this repository to your local machine and `cd` into it:

```sh
$ git clone "your fork's URL"

$ cd de-py-katas
```

We are going to use the `make` command to perform some of the standard tasks for this repo. We'll cover `make` in more detail later in the course.

The first task is to set up your **virtual environment**.

Run this command in a terminal:
```bash
make create-environment
```

You should see the `venv` directory appear within the project folder.

Using `make` as described below wil mean you don't have to activate your environment.

After creating your virtual environment, we can install `pytest` by running:
```bash
make pytest
```

The `pytest` library will be used for unit tests. Additionally, there will be `flake8` checks to make sure for PEP8 compliance in the later katas, this will be checked via `make`. 

In the terminal, navigate to the root directory of the project, and run:

```
make flake
```

Then, you can use the command below to run your all tests and check for PEP8 compliance:

```
make run-checks
```

Work on the katas and commit changes as needed. When you are happy with your solution, push all your changes to your forked repo. You should push to your fork frequently but as a bare minimum please make sure it's up to date with last week's kata solutions before Monday morning each week:

```sh
$ git push origin main
```
